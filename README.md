**Question A:**
Test Cases:
  1. [ {1,3} , {2,4} ] General Overlap 
  2. [ {1,5} , {1,4} ] One line being completely bigger than the other - Overlap
  3. [ {1,5} , {5,6} ] No overlap - assumption: last point being equal means no overlap
  4. [ {1,2} , {3,4} ] No overlap
  5. [ {1,1} , {1,1} ] Overlap since it is a single point
